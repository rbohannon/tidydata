CODE BOOK for tidyData.txt

This dataset contains the means of the features described below. The original dataset is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>. This is a Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Adapted from the original source, features_info.txt (modified for this document):
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAccelXYZ and timeGravityAccelXYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelJerkXYZ and timeBodyGyroJerkXYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelMag, timeGravityAccelMag, timeBodyAccelJerkMag, timeBodyGyroMag, timeBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing freqBodyAccelXYZ, freqBodyAccelJerkXYZ, freqBodyGyroXYZ, freqBodyAccelJerkMag, freqBodyGyroMag, freqBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'freq' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

- end adaptation.

Naming convention for variables:
'time' indicates a time domain signal
'freq' indocates a a frquency domain sigal
'Body' indicates a signal generated by the subject's body
'Gravity' indicates a signal generated by gravity
'Accel' indicates a signal from the device accelerometer
'Gyro' indicates a signal from the device gyroscope
'Jerk' indicates a signal caused by body movement (body linear acceleration and angular velocity)
'Mag' indicates the magnitude of the referenced signal
'X', 'Y', 'Z' indicates the axis on which the signal is measured
